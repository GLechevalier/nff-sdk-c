/* nff_store.h — persistent storage of operational credentials in NVS (claim rollover).
 *
 * After a device is accepted, the fleet rolls over a UNIQUE per-device certificate to it
 * (DEVICE_OWNERSHIP_DESIGN.md §8). That cert/key/chain is persisted here, in NVS, so it survives
 * reboots and firmware OTAs — the firmware-baked bootstrap credential is only ever a fallback used
 * when NVS holds no operational creds (i.e. the device is still unclaimed).
 *
 * The NVS port is string-only (and the POSIX mock caps a value at 256 bytes), so DER blobs are
 * base64-encoded and split into <=200-char chunks across keys {prefix}.0..{prefix}.n with a count
 * at {prefix}.n. The single "claimed" flag is written LAST and is the sole gate, so a crash mid-write
 * leaves the device unclaimed (it re-enters bootstrap and overwrites the half-written creds).
